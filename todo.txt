## Project Overview
This is a web-based abnormal finding reporting system for plant operations that integrates with an existing Cedar CMMS system. The application will have three user roles (L1 Operators, L2 Engineers, L3 Managers) and provide real-time reporting, workflow automation, and analytics.

## Key Components to Build:

### 1. **Core Infrastructure** (Items 1-4)
- Project setup with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Database design for tickets, users, and audit trails
- JWT authentication system
- Role-based access control for three user levels

### 2. **Core Functionality** (Items 5-7)
- Ticket creation with machine/area selection and image upload
- Workflow automation with assignment rules
- Notification system using LINE OA and email

### 3. **User Interface & Analytics** (Items 8-10)
- Main dashboard with real-time metrics
- Analytics dashboard with filtering and export capabilities
- Comprehensive audit trail system

### 4. **Integration & Storage** (Items 11-13)
- Cedar CMMS integration API layer
- Data synchronization with SQL Server
- Local image storage system

### 5. **Administration & Security** (Items 14-16)
- Admin module for user management
- Security protocols and data integrity
- Testing and deployment

The system will be hosted on-premises and integrate seamlessly with the existing Cedar CMMS Windows application while providing modern web-based functionality for plant users to report and track abnormal findings efficiently.
